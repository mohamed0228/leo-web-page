                Known as an innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus
on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my
audience for an impactful user experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a
recent project. I worked on a team of four to develop a single-page MERN app that helps 
users to buy flowers from any part in the word, inventory, and attendance at specialty events. Iâ€™m excited to
leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the
web.
